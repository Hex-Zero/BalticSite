                <p>
                  Safeguarding is essential in assuring the development and
                  well-being of young people and adults alike. Safeguarding is
                  the action that is taken to promote the welfare of young
                  adults to protect them from harm.&nbsp;The potential harm that
                  can affect learners is wide-ranging and includes things such
                  as; bullying, inappropriate supervision and unsafe workplaces
                  or working practices.
                </p>
                <p>

                  working environments and that we provide learners with the
                  information and advice on how they can keep themselves safe,
                  to carefully selecting the employers we work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have a number of specially appointed staff to lead on
                  Safeguarding matters who are available to discuss any concerns
